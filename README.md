# Concentration_Inequalities
1. Checking sub-Gaussianity of Chi_sq(n) as a function of n empirically.
2. a.Sub-Gaussianity of a Uniform rv with [-a, a] range.
 . b.Non-sub-Gaussianity of a Laplacian rv with zero mean and variance of 2b^2.   
3. comparing the sharpness/tightness of the tail bound due to Bennett’s inequality with Hoeffding’s inequality and Chernoff’s inequality using appropriate plots.
